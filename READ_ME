=================  Folders  ==================
==============================================


calibrating pics: Collection of pictures used to calibrate the cameras. You shouldn't need to access these

C Programs: Programs converted to C using cython. Most likely unneccesary to access.

Executables: Files converted to executables. Need to first be converted to C, then into executables. Most likely outdated.

Graveyard On Fire: [REDACTED]

npz Files: These are calibration files attributed to cameras 1-6. To use, the program will need to be redirected to pull from that file.

=================  Programs  ==================
===============================================

capture.py: Used to write what is being viewed through the camera directly to file.

display.py: Direct feed of camera

displayPic.py: shows image. Used when you want to overlay lines or dots onto image.

finalCalibrate.py: Used to calibrate a camera to compensate for radial distortion. Uses several pictures of a checkerboard. Saves the results to an npz file.

transformVideoClean.py: finds a line on the ground, and sends coordinates and angle through a udp packet to roborio.

undistortedTracking.py: finds a line on the ground, and presents it on the screen.

RRHSV.py: used to find hsv values that the camera detects off a retroreflective tape.

PoseEstimation.py: finds a pair of lines on a wall, and displays the distance.

PoseEstimationSend.py: finds a pair of lines on a wall, and sends distance and angle through a udp packet to roborio.
